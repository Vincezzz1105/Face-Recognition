# Face-Recognition

# Fake AI-Generated Photo Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect whether an image is real or generated by artificial intelligence (fake). Using a deep learning approach, specifically leveraging the ResNet50 architecture, the model classifies input images as either **real** or **fake**.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Deepfake Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tusharpadhy/deepfake-dataset), containing:
- **Training set:** 240,002 images
- **Validation set:** 59,428 images
- **Testing set:** 30,905 images

Images have been resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized for model training.

## Model

### Architecture
- **ResNet50**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its deep structure and effective performance in image classification tasks. 

### Training Details
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross Entropy Loss (BCEWithLogitsLoss)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 10

## Performance
- **Final Training Accuracy**: 98.81%
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: 96.48%
- **Validation Loss**: 0.1083

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy and average loss metrics. Predictions are made with a threshold of 0.5 for classification.

## Requirements
- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- tqdm
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
1. Install Python and pip.
